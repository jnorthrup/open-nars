Open-NARS is the open source version of the [NARS](http://sites.google.com/site/narswang/home) project, which attempts to uniformly explain and reproduce many cognitive facilities, including reasoning, learning, planning, etc, so as to provide a unified theory, model, and system for AI as a whole. The ultimate goal of this research is to build a thinking machine.

What makes NARS different from conventional computer systems is its ability to _learn_ from its experience and to work with _insufficient_ knowledge and resources.

This project is still mostly at the conceptual design and prototype development stage. If you are interested to join this research, the best place to start reading is the [Wiki pages](https://code.google.com/p/open-nars/w/list), not the source code.

The current stable versions of the system are available for  [download](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B8Z4Yige07tBUk5LSUtxSGY0eVk&usp=sharing). Each version contains a JAR file and some working examples. [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/java8-2100321.html) is needed to run the recent versions.

The source code maintained at this site is for OpenNARS 1.5.7. After that, the development has moved to the [GitHub site](https://github.com/opennars/opennars), though this site still serves as the portal of this open-source project.
